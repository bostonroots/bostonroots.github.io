        Our Mission
      </h1>
      <p>
        Boston Roots is a nonprofit organization that seeks to shrink the opportunity gap in our country by empowering students to succeed through the college admissions process and beyond. We work with Boston Public School students from underserved districts, that face high barriers to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lack of access to college counseling services, financial information, and SAT/ACT prep courses are only part of the setbacks that so many students face. Boston Roots seeks to provide guidance and college prep services at no cost to students motivated to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is done by connecting students to 3rd party counselors and financial providers. Unlike other college access program, Boston Roots firmly believes that parent involvement contributes to a higher degree of student success. As a result, our program works with parents to give their children greater support through parent seminars. Topics include student progress, financial saving information, and support strategies to motivate students.

        Our Program (subject to change)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Boston Roots’ program consists of a 4 part approach called CADS. This acronym stands for, “College counseling, Academic/test tutoring, Dual Enrollment, and Student finance. Through this model, Boston Roots aims to provide a full-fledged, comprehensive college preparation program for its students.
      </p>
      <h3>College Counseling</h3>
      <p>
        Our college counseling program seeks to provide students with the same quality and depth as any other private college preparation program. We hold routine meetings with our students, check up with them through email, help look over essays, and review our students’ college applications. We provide suggestions and advice in terms of what colleges/programs our students should apply for.
      </p>
      <h3>Student Finance</h3>
      <p>
        Boston Roots understands many of its students might have some concerns with the financial burdens of higher education. Thus, we have created a model that involves utilizing available forms of financial aid and scholarships to make sure our students can attend the university or college they aim for.

      <p>
        Since its creation, Boston Roots has garnered a strong team of college students from prestigious institutions from across North America and Europe (including Imperial College, McGill University, Harvard, UMass Amherst, etc.), consulted a variety of nonprofits concerned with increasing college access, professional counselors, and admissions officers at a variety of colleges in order to ensure that we provide the most beneficial program to high school mentees.
      </p>
